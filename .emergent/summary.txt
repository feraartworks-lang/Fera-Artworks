<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a global platform called Imperial Art Gallery (originally Ferâ) for the ownership, transfer, resale, and return of unique digital artworks. The ownership model is based on a license that grants exclusive access to the art. Key features include a secure viewer, an irreversible download action that voids return/resale rights, and P2P resale for unused artworks. The financial model includes a 5% purchase fee, a 1% P2P commission, and a 1% withdrawal fee, all handled through a custom, Stripe-free system for Account-to-Account (A2A) bank transfers and USDT crypto payments, reconciled manually by an admin. Authentication includes Email/Password, Google Auth, and Web3 wallets (MetaMask/WalletConnect). A secure admin panel with 2FA is required for platform management.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **License-Based Ownership:** Unique, exclusive, and traceable license for each artwork.
- **Secure Viewer & Irreversible Download:** Purchased art is viewed securely. Downloading the file is an irreversible usage action.
- **P2P Resale & Returns:** Users can resell or return artworks only if the  flag is .
- **Custom Payment System:** No Stripe. A2A and USDT payments with manual admin reconciliation via unique reference codes.
- **Multi-faceted Authentication:** JWT, Google, MetaMask, and WalletConnect.
- **Comprehensive Admin Panel:** For managing users, artworks, transactions, and security.
- **Audit Logs:** Log all significant platform actions.

**User's preferred language**: Türkçe (Turkish)

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI + React) with a robust set of features. User authentication (JWT, Google, MetaMask, WalletConnect) is functional. A custom, Stripe-free payment system for both A2A bank transfers and USDT is fully implemented and tested, relying on manual admin reconciliation. The platform has a secure admin panel with Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP). A unique, immutable  system has been integrated throughout the app. Numerous informational pages (FAQ, Privacy Policy, etc.) have been created. An email notification system for the contact form is active using Resend. The agent was in the middle of a complete UI/UX overhaul to a Renaissance theme, as requested by the user.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Implementing a major UI/UX overhaul based on a Renaissance theme. The user found the previous design too simple and wanted a more sophisticated look for a high-end audience. The  was used to generate a new design system (), and the agent began implementation by overwriting the global CSS file () and was about to redesign the Landing Page.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent, after the full redesign is complete to ensure visual consistency and no functional regressions.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  There are no pending bugs. The main focus is the in-progress redesign task.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete the Renaissance UI/UX Redesign (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The agent has updated the global stylesheet . The immediate next step is to redesign the Landing Page () and then systematically update all other pages and components (Navbar, Footer, Buttons, Cards, etc.) to align with the new aesthetic defined in . This includes applying the new color palette, fonts, and adding animations.
     - What will be achieved with this? A complete visual transformation of the application to meet the user's request for a sophisticated, Renaissance-themed design suitable for a high-end audience.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both (frontend for visual and functional correctness, backend for regression).
     - Blocked on something: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P1: Re-enable and Implement P2P Marketplace Logic:**
        - Remove the Coming Soon overlay from the marketplace page.
        - Implement the backend logic for P2P sales, ensuring the new owner's rights are correctly transferred.
        - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Implement logic to ensure that after a P2P sale, the new owner does **not** have the right to a refund. This right is exclusive to the initial buyer.

    Future Tasks:
    - **Automate Payment Reconciliation:** Implement a blockchain listener (for USDT) and an Open Banking integration/statement parser (for A2A) to automate payment confirmations.
    - **Expand Email Notification System:** Use the existing Resend integration to send transactional emails for order confirmations, password resets, etc.

**Completed work in this session**
- **USDT Payment Flow Verification:** The USDT payment workflow was tested end-to-end, from user purchase to admin confirmation and artwork delivery, and confirmed to be fully functional.
- **Frontend Auth Persistence Fix:** Resolved a race condition that caused premature redirection to the login page.
- **Platform Rebranding:** Renamed the platform to Imperial Art Gallery across all frontend and backend files.
- **Database Cleanup:** Purged all test/demo data, leaving only the admin account.
- **Creation of Multiple Informational Pages:** Built, styled, and routed the following pages:
    - , , , , , , .
- **Unique License ID System:** Architected and integrated a unique, immutable  for every artwork, visible across the Gallery, Artwork Detail, Checkout, Secure Viewer, and User Dashboard pages.
- **Contact Form Email Integration (Resend):** Implemented an endpoint that uses Resend to forward contact form submissions to the admin's email ().
- **WalletConnect Integration:** Updated the app to use the user's official Project ID and fixed issues preventing the QR code from displaying.
- **Admin Credential Update:** Changed the admin password as requested.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (), Resend (for emails).
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, , .
- **Authentication:** JWT, Google OAuth, Web3 (MetaMask/WalletConnect signature), Admin 2FA (TOTP).
- **Payments:** Custom-built A2A (bank transfer) and USDT (crypto) flows with manual admin reconciliation.

**key DB schema**
  - **artworks**:  (This new field is mandatory)
  - **contact_submissions**:  (New collection for logging contact form submissions)
  - **users**: 
  - **payment_orders**: 

**All files of reference**
- : **CRITICAL:** This new file contains the entire design system for the Renaissance UI overhaul. The next agent must adhere to it strictly.
- : Overwritten with new global styles for the Renaissance theme.
- : Modified to add the  logic and the  endpoint with Resend integration.
- : Numerous new pages were created (, , , , , , ).
- : Updated with .
- : Updated with  and .

**key api endpoints**
- : (NEW) Handles contact form submissions, logs them to the DB, and sends an email to the admin via Resend.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **UI REDESIGN IS THE TOP PRIORITY:** You must continue the UI/UX overhaul based on the Renaissance theme defined in . This is a large task that involves updating every page and component. Start with the Landing Page.
- **P2P REFUND LOGIC:** When implementing the P2P marketplace, remember the user's critical requirement: the resale buyer does **not** get refund rights. This right is reserved for the initial buyer only.
- **DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT:** The user plans to deploy on their own infrastructure (like Railway or DigitalOcean), not Emergent. Therefore, all Web3 features (MetaMask, WalletConnect) must be preserved. The user will need to set up their own environment variables and Google OAuth credentials post-deployment.
